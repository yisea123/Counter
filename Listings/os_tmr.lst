N     * Copies or moves a piece of memory from one place to another,

N     * part way through a byte, and you can copy between regions
N     * with different alignment within a byte.
N     * 
N     * All these functions have the same prototype: two void *

N     * giving the bit offset from those pointers, and finally the
N     * number of bits to copy.
N     * 
N     * Just like memcpy and memmove, the "cpy" functions copy as

N     * do not overlap, while the "move" functions cope correctly
N     * with overlap.
N     *
N     * Treating memory as a stream of individual bits requires

N     * considered to be arranged in. The above functions support
N     * multiple conventions:
N     * 
N     *  - the "bl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the

N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion, so that the LSB comes
N     *    first. (For example, membitcpybl(a,b,0,7,1) would copy
N     *    the MSB of the byte at b to the LSB of the byte at a.)
N     * 
N     *  - the "bb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion, so that the MSB comes
N     *    first.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in big-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion.

N*
N* 1) Your application MUST define the following #define constants:
N*
N*    OS_TASK_TMR_PRIO          The priority of the Timer management task
N*    OS_TASK_TMR_STK_SIZE      The size     of the Timer management task's stack
N*
N* 2) You must call OSTmrSignal() to notify the Timer management task that it's time to update the timers.

N*                                                   CREATE A TIMER
N*
N* Description: This function is called by your application code to create a timer.
N*
N* Arguments  : dly           Initial delay.
N*                            If the timer is configured for ONE-SHOT mode, this is the timeout used
N*                            If the timer is configured for PERIODIC mode, this is the first timeout to wait for
N*                               before the timer starts entering periodic mode
N*
N*              period        The 'period' being repeated for the timer.
N*                               If you specified 'OS_TMR_OPT_PERIODIC' as an option, when the timer expires, it will
N*                               automatically restart with the same period.
N*
N*              opt           Specifies either:
N*                               OS_TMR_OPT_ONE_SHOT       The timer counts down only once
N*                               OS_TMR_OPT_PERIODIC       The timer counts down and then reloads itself
N*
N*              callback      Is a pointer to a callback function that will be called when the timer expires.  The
N*                               callback function must be declared as follows:
N*
N*                               void MyCallback (OS_TMR *ptmr, void *p_arg);
N*
N*              callback_arg  Is an argument (a pointer) that is passed to the callback function when it is called.
N*
N*              pname         Is a pointer to an ASCII string that is used to name the timer.  Names are useful for
N*                               debugging.
N*
N*              perr          Is a pointer to an error code.  '*perr' will contain one of the following:
N*                               OS_ERR_NONE
N*                               OS_ERR_TMR_INVALID_DLY     you specified an invalid delay
N*                               OS_ERR_TMR_INVALID_PERIOD  you specified an invalid period
N*                               OS_ERR_TMR_INVALID_OPT     you specified an invalid option
N*                               OS_ERR_TMR_ISR             if the call was made from an ISR
N*                               OS_ERR_TMR_NON_AVAIL       if there are no free timers from the timer pool
N*
N* Returns    : A pointer to an OS_TMR data structure.
N*              This is the 'handle' that your application will use to reference the timer created.

N*                                      SIGNAL THAT IT'S TIME TO UPDATE THE TIMERS
N*
N* Description: This function is typically called by the ISR that occurs at the timer tick rate and is used to signal to
N*              OSTmr_Task() that it's time to update the timers.
N*
N* Arguments  : none
N*
N* Returns    : OS_ERR_NONE         The call was successful and the timer task was signaled.
N*              OS_ERR_SEM_OVF      If OSTmrSignal() was called more often than OSTmr_Task() can handle the timers.
N*                                  This would indicate that your system is heavily loaded.
N*              OS_ERR_EVENT_TYPE   Unlikely you would get this error because the semaphore used for signaling is created
N*                                  by uC/OS-II.
N*              OS_ERR_PEVENT_NULL  Again, unlikely you would ever get this error because the semaphore used for signaling
N*                                  is created by uC/OS-II.
