N     * Copies or moves a piece of memory from one place to another,
N     * with one-bit granularity. So you can start or finish a copy
N     * part way through a byte, and you can copy between regions
N     * with different alignment within a byte.
N     * 
N     * All these functions have the same prototype: two void *
N     * pointers for destination and source, then two integers
N     * giving the bit offset from those pointers, and finally the
N     * number of bits to copy.
N     * 
N     * Just like memcpy and memmove, the "cpy" functions copy as

N     * do not overlap, while the "move" functions cope correctly
N     * with overlap.
N     *
N     * Treating memory as a stream of individual bits requires

N     * considered to be arranged in. The above functions support
N     * multiple conventions:
N     * 
N     *  - the "bl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the

N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion, so that the LSB comes
N     *    first. (For example, membitcpybl(a,b,0,7,1) would copy
N     *    the MSB of the byte at b to the LSB of the byte at a.)
N     * 
N     *  - the "bb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion, so that the MSB comes
N     *    first.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in big-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion.

N*                                      PEND ON MULTIPLE EVENTS
N*
N* Description: This function waits for multiple events.  If multiple events are ready at the start of the
N*              pend call, then all available events are returned as ready.  If the task must pend on the
N*              multiple events, then only the first posted or aborted event is returned as ready.
N*
N* Arguments  : pevents_pend  is a pointer to a NULL-terminated array of event control blocks to wait for.
N*
N*              pevents_rdy   is a pointer to an array to return which event control blocks are available
N*                            or ready.  The size of the array MUST be greater than or equal to the size
N*                            of the 'pevents_pend' array, including terminating NULL.
N*
N*              pmsgs_rdy     is a pointer to an array to return messages from any available message-type
N*                            events.  The size of the array MUST be greater than or equal to the size of
N*                            the 'pevents_pend' array, excluding the terminating NULL.  Since NULL
N*                            messages are valid messages, this array cannot be NULL-terminated.  Instead,
N*                            every available message-type event returns its messages in the 'pmsgs_rdy'
N*                            array at the same index as the event is returned in the 'pevents_rdy' array.
N*                            All other 'pmsgs_rdy' array indices are filled with NULL messages.
N*
N*              timeout       is an optional timeout period (in clock ticks).  If non-zero, your task will
N*                            wait for the resources up to the amount of time specified by this argument.
N*                            If you specify 0, however, your task will wait forever for the specified
N*                            events or, until the resources becomes available (or the events occur).
N*
N*              perr          is a pointer to where an error message will be deposited.  Possible error
N*                            messages are:
N*
N*                            OS_ERR_NONE         The call was successful and your task owns the resources
N*                                                or, the events you are waiting for occurred; check the
N*                                                'pevents_rdy' array for which events are available.
N*                            OS_ERR_PEND_ABORT   The wait on the events was aborted; check the
N*                                                'pevents_rdy' array for which events were aborted.
N*                            OS_ERR_TIMEOUT      The events were not received within the specified
N*                                                'timeout'.
N*                            OS_ERR_PEVENT_NULL  If 'pevents_pend', 'pevents_rdy', or 'pmsgs_rdy' is a
N*                                                NULL pointer.
N*                            OS_ERR_EVENT_TYPE   If you didn't pass a pointer to an array of semaphores,
N*                                                mailboxes, and/or queues.
N*                            OS_ERR_PEND_ISR     If you called this function from an ISR and the result
N*                                                would lead to a suspension.
N*                            OS_ERR_PEND_LOCKED  If you called this function when the scheduler is locked.
N*
N* Returns    : >  0          the number of events returned as ready or aborted.
N*              == 0          if no events are returned as ready because of timeout or upon error.
N*
N* Notes      : 1) a. Validate 'pevents_pend' array as valid OS_EVENTs :
N*
N*                        semaphores, mailboxes, queues
N*
N*                 b. Return ALL available events and messages, if any
N*
N*                 c. Add    current task priority as pending to   each events's wait list
N*                      Performed in OS_EventTaskWaitMulti()
N*
N*                 d. Wait on any of multiple events
N*
N*                 e. Remove current task priority as pending from each events's wait list
N*                      Performed in OS_EventTaskRdy(), if events posted or aborted
N*
N*                 f. Return any event posted or aborted, if any
N*                      else
N*                    Return timeout
N*
N*              2) 'pevents_rdy' initialized to NULL PRIOR to all other validation or function handling in
N*                 case of any error(s).

N*                                              ENTER ISR
N*
N* Description: This function is used to notify uC/OS-II that you are about to service an interrupt
N*              service routine (ISR).  This allows uC/OS-II to keep track of interrupt nesting and thus
N*              only perform rescheduling at the last nested ISR.
N*
N* Arguments  : none
N*
N* Returns    : none
N*
N* Notes      : 1) This function should be called ith interrupts already disabled
N*              2) Your ISR can directly increment OSIntNesting without calling this function because
N*                 OSIntNesting has been declared 'global'.
N*              3) You MUST still call OSIntExit() even though you increment OSIntNesting directly.
N*              4) You MUST invoke OSIntEnter() and OSIntExit() in pair.  In other words, for every call
N*                 to OSIntEnter() at the beginning of the ISR you MUST have a call to OSIntExit() at the
N*                 end of the ISR.
N*              5) You are allowed to nest interrupts up to 255 levels deep.
N*              6) I removed the OS_ENTER_CRITICAL() and OS_EXIT_CRITICAL() around the increment because
N*                 OSIntEnter() is always called with interrupts disabled.

N*                                              IDLE TASK
N*
N* Description: This task is internal to uC/OS-II and executes whenever no other higher priority tasks
N*              executes because they are ALL waiting for event(s) to occur.
N*
N* Arguments  : none
N*
N* Returns    : none
N*
N* Note(s)    : 1) OSTaskIdleHook() is called after the critical section to ensure that interrupts will be
N*                 enabled for at least a few instructions.  On some processors (ex. Philips XA), enabling
N*                 and then disabling interrupts didn't allow the processor enough time to have interrupts
N*                 enabled before they were disabled again.  uC/OS-II would thus never recognize
N*                 interrupts.
N*              2) This hook has been added to allow you to do such things as STOP the CPU to conserve
N*                 power.

N*                                            STATISTICS TASK
N*
N* Description: This task is internal to uC/OS-II and is used to compute some statistics about the
N*              multitasking environment.  Specifically, OS_TaskStat() computes the CPU usage.
N*              CPU usage is determined by:
N*
N*                                          OSIdleCtr
N*                 OSCPUUsage = 100 * (1 - ------------)     (units are in %)

N*
N* Arguments  : parg     this pointer is not used at this time.
N*
N* Returns    : none
N*
N* Notes      : 1) This task runs at a priority level higher than the idle task.  In fact, it runs at the
N*                 next higher priority, OS_TASK_IDLE_PRIO-1.
N*              2) You can disable this task by setting the configuration #define OS_TASK_STAT_EN to 0.
N*              3) You MUST have at least a delay of 2/10 seconds to allow for the system to establish the
N*                 maximum value for the idle counter.

N*                                            INITIALIZE TCB
N*
N* Description: This function is internal to uC/OS-II and is used to initialize a Task Control Block when
N*              a task is created (see OSTaskCreate() and OSTaskCreateExt()).
N*
N* Arguments  : prio          is the priority of the task being created
N*
N*              ptos          is a pointer to the task's top-of-stack assuming that the CPU registers
N*                            have been placed on the stack.  Note that the top-of-stack corresponds to a
N*                            'high' memory location is OS_STK_GROWTH is set to 1 and a 'low' memory
N*                            location if OS_STK_GROWTH is set to 0.  Note that stack growth is CPU
N*                            specific.
N*
N*              pbos          is a pointer to the bottom of stack.  A NULL pointer is passed if called by
N*                            'OSTaskCreate()'.
N*
N*              id            is the task's ID (0..65535)
N*
N*              stk_size      is the size of the stack (in 'stack units').  If the stack units are INT8Us
N*                            then, 'stk_size' contains the number of bytes for the stack.  If the stack
N*                            units are INT32Us then, the stack contains '4 * stk_size' bytes.  The stack
N*                            units are established by the #define constant OS_STK which is CPU
N*                            specific.  'stk_size' is 0 if called by 'OSTaskCreate()'.
N*
N*              pext          is a pointer to a user supplied memory area that is used to extend the task
N*                            control block.  This allows you to store the contents of floating-point
N*                            registers, MMU registers or anything else you could find useful during a
N*                            context switch.  You can even assign a name to each task and store this name
N*                            in this TCB extension.  A NULL pointer is passed if called by OSTaskCreate().
N*
N*              opt           options as passed to 'OSTaskCreateExt()' or,
N*                            0 if called from 'OSTaskCreate()'.
N*
N* Returns    : OS_ERR_NONE         if the call was successful
N*              OS_ERR_TASK_NO_MORE_TCB  if there are no more free TCBs to be allocated and thus, the task cannot
N*                                  be created.
